The programmer could use VSc to read the source code.To compile the program the programmer could input  
./robot 2 3 east | java -jar drawapp-2.0.jar.  The pair of numbers is the starting positionof the robot, and the "east" 
means the direction of robot which it pointed initially. Then the robot would begin to move forward. If the robot 
touches the grid or the obstacle which is red, it would turn right and continue to move forward until it finds the marker which is gray.
